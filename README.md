 ## Election-Audit Summary
 - This script can be used for future elections as is if the data imported is in the same format and data type.  Additional information can be obtained with modification to the code such as a specific county breakdown showing which canadiate was more favored in each county.  
 - Likewise, it can be used with slight modification to include additional data columns to provide a more detailed breakdown of the voting result.  For instance, collecting further demographics with each ballot(age, gender, party affiliation, etc.) would result in the ability to give a more detailed look into which of the groups favored one canadiate or the other.
